Yulu bikes is a micro-mobility service provider in India. They have seen considerable dips in their revenues recently and want to understand the key factors driving demand for their electric bike sharing service.

**Data**
The data spans daily rental data from 01-Jan-2011 to 31-Dec-2012. It includes variables like:

The analysis focuses on identifying trends, patterns and relationships between the demand (count of rentals) and explanatory variables like weather, seasons etc. using statistical analysis and visualizations.

**Insights**
Key insights and recommendations provided to the client include:
